Measuring Developer contribution and productivity

This project aims to measure developer contribution to a project. Measurement of Developer contribution is controversial given the qualitative nature of generating code. Nonetheless, we can get to a good approximation of a developers contribution based on various features like code complexity, bugs identified in a developers code over a period of time, lines of code, Tech Debt etc. The question is can we really get quantitative measures of attributes other than LOC (Lines of code). This project is an attempt to generate numerical values for these attributes of contribution. The resultant numbers can be used:
1. by Developers to understand where they can improve to become more productive.
2. by Proj. and tech Leaders to identify and nurture productive developers and in addition, to design programs and assign mentors to low productive developers. They can also be used to watch the journey of developer improvement and maturity.
3. Open Source communities to encourage promising new members

cg is short for Chitragupta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitragupta) the score keeper of good and bad deeds in Hindu mythology. We picked this as a temporary name for the project.
